*Inspired* to answer the call to assist medical professionals reduce pneumonia related cases while intubated using machine learning to detect pneumonia in patients, through routine x ray scans. 

# What it does
Our Convolutional Neural Network takes data and analyzes visual imagery to detect pneumonia at the earliest stages. 

# How we built it
Due to the limitation of data, we chose to use a dataset provided by Kaggle containing about 6000 grey-scaled images, consisting of training, validating and testing sets. We take this supervised learning data and utilize convolutional neural network, CNN which is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. Once Pneumonia is detected, an alert is sent out to a service professional. This shortens the time necessary to screen the patients for treatment of the infection.

# Challenges we ran into
Challenges include the lack of data specific to our cause. We compromised regarding x ray images by using individuals’ scans not intubated as for proof of concept. 

# Accomplishments we’re proud of
To present this working model as a proof of concept.
